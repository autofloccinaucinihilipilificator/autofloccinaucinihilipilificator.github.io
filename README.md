# Netherlands Election Tool
## Robert Zhu

There's a bunch of websites on the Internet where you can click to fill in a map of U.S. House district, British Parliament constituencies, etc. and visualize how many seats  in the legislature each party wins based on how the map is colored in. A lot of countries don't elect their legislatures this way, though; instead, all the votes for a party are tallied up nationwide and seats are distributed accordingly. I thought the tools online for visualizing these weren't great and so I decided I wanted to make one myself.

Enter the hypothetical vote share for each party using its input box or slider. The website will then calculate how many seats each party won and which out of several pre-selected coalitions are possible. There's a whole bunch of other things I wanted to add: some actual CSS, pie and [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_apportionment_diagram) charts, a clickable map (for e.g. the [German system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system_of_Germany), proper presets, adding and removing parties and coalitions, and a bunch more.

It's a website hosted on Github Pages.
